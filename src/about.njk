	<h1>About</h1>

  <p>A long time ago â€“ in 2011, to be precise â€“ I worked at a company that had many large projects in flight at any given time. Some were huge behemoths, some were small skunk-works projects, and there were every type of project in between. One of the largest and longest running was called (for reasons I never did discover) <strong>LaserWolf</strong>.</p>

  <p>I thought no more about it until I heard of another project codenamed <strong>SlimePig</strong>, and then another called <strong>ThunderPony</strong>, and at that point I detected both a pattern and an opportunity.</p>

  <p>Enter stage left, Cliveâ€™s Project Namer.</p>

  <p>A simple premise: to supply upon page load, a two-part project codename, the first part being some adjective and the second part the name of an animal or creature. Soon after launch, many projects within the organisation were being named by my little web toy.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>Itâ€™s not used so much now. Thinking has shifted to a more practical way of doing things, usually naming a thing after what it does or is intended to do. But that hasn't stopped me from returning to my little toy 14 years later and finally adding the feature I always meant to include... categories!</p>

  <p>Want to limit your project names to only land-based creatures? You can! Do you want to harness both colour- and material-based prefixes? I got you! Do you want only the creatures of the sea, and the prefixes of science? Who am I to argue?</p>
